# ASL Sign Recongition using SVM, Decision Trees and Neural Networks

In this project, we develop a computing system that can understand human gestures. In specific, we attempt to recognise ASL signs for the following words:
1. ABOUT		https://www.signingsavvy.com/sign/ABOUT/32/1
2. AND		https://www.signingsavvy.com/sign/AND/888/1
3. CAN		https://www.signingsavvy.com/sign/CAN/524/1
4. COP		https://www.signingsavvy.com/sign/COP/3203/1
5. DEAF		https://www.signingsavvy.com/sign/DEAF/102/1
6. DECIDE		https://www.signingsavvy.com/sign/DECIDE/781/1
7. FATHER		https://www.signingsavvy.com/sign/FATHER/3440/1
8. FIND		https://www.signingsavvy.com/sign/FIND/146/1
9. GO OUT	https://www.signingsavvy.com/sign/GO+OUT
10. HEARING	https://www.signingsavvy.com/sign/HEARING/3594/1

Phase 1: Data collection <br />
Phase 2: Feature Extraction, PCA <br />
Phase 3: Training SVM, Decision Tree and Neural Networks, User Dependent Analysis <br />
Phase 4: User Independent Analysis <br />
